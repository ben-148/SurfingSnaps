# PicPort

The project is a website for selling surfing photos, with visually appealing forms to display the photos. It includes a registration and login system for users to create accounts. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Bootstrap librarie for styling features.

## About the Project

In the project I was required to show programming skills in modern javascript based on html and css that we learned in the previous models.
The project gave a lot of opportunity to learn and specialize in the subjects studied, starting with the programming itself, through the architecture of the files and the links between the pages in the modular method.

## Usage

In order to run the project, the index page must be opened via Live Server
